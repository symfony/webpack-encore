@weaverryan this is a new PR to fix #1158, after https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v4.1.0 has been released.

I confirm, without this fix, the package cannot be installed:
```
$ npm upgrade @symfony/webpack-encore
npm ERR! code EINVALIDTAGNAME
npm ERR! Invalid tag name "^2.6|^3.2.14" of package "vue@^2.6|^3.2.14": Tags may not have any characters that encodeURIComponent encodes.
```
