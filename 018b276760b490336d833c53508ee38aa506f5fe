We should definitely make a test for the pubic API, to prevents such cases in future. Do you think you could add some @ldiringer ?

what do you think if `api.js` file get renamed to `index.js`, that way it explicitly says what part is testing?

tests look great!. Thank you very much, i hope this get merged soon.
