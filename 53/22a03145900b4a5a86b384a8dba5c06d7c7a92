Hi @weaverryan, I know why the builds fail; however what am I supposed to do? Revert the change in yarn.lock?

Lol, yup, I expected this. Node packages drop support for old Node versions quite aggressively.

Bump our (Encore's) minimum Node version to 14. And then we'll do a 3.0 release. Ref: https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/issues/1079#issuecomment-1109744828

Done :)

By the way do you want me to add node 18 to the workflows?

Hmm, yes! That would be great - good catch!

Hmm. Node 18 tests fail... even using the "locked" dependencies. And the failure is weird... I'm not sure what's going on...

Just ran tests for node 18 locally (thank you nvm), aaaaand... they all pass.

Grrrr. Those are the worst! I'm going to merge... and hope that the issue just solves itself.
