I've added a small TypeScript-specific code, and tests pass fine.
It should be ok now :+1:

Wait a second :).

If Babel is a *better* way to compile Typescript - I was just reading this article https://iamturns.com/typescript-babel/ - then why not make it a first-class citizen? Maybe we add a new:

```
Encore.enableBabelTypeScriptPreset()
```

And it takes care of everything for you:

1) The warning on what you need to install
2) Adding the preset to your Babel config (similar to what we do with `enableReactPreset()` and (I guess?) also the `@babel/proposal-class-properties` plugin
3) Tweak the babel loader test to include .tsx? files

WDYT?

I don't know if it's a _better_ way to _compile_ TypeScript with Babel, but that's an interesting alternative.

But note that you lose TypeScript _power_ at compilation since every types are removed during transpilation. You need to run `tsc` manually to check your `.ts` files (it can be done in CI for example), **we should document it**.

However, `Encore.enableBabelTypeScriptPreset()` sounds nice if it can make our life easier ðŸ˜„

I will try to work on it tonight :)

@weaverryan I've added support to `Encore.enableBabelTypeScriptPreset()`

Hi @Lyrkan, thanks for your review.
I fixed the error message and added two tests in `config-generator.js`.
