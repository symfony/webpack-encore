Failures are due to: https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/92... which is unrelated to us, and will hopefully get resolved shortly.

yeah, too bad that JS regexp does not have possessive quantifiers. In PHP, they would allow fixing the issue very easily (we did such fixes in Symfony).

> Remove the old webpack-manifest-plugin.js file entirely and update paths to require the actual library instead of this

I'd keep the file for now with only the export of the real plugin and a `logger.deprecation(...)` in it in case someone currently uses it to do something like:

```js
const Encore = require('@symfony/webpack-encore');
const ManifestPlugin = require('@symfony/webpack-encore/lib/webpack/webpack-manifest-plugin.js');

// (...)

const config = Encore.getWebpackConfig();

for (const plugin of config.plugins) {
    if (plugin instanceof ManifestPlugin) {
        // Do something with its config
    }
}

module.exports = config;
```

Hmm, interesting point - I'm cool with that :). In general, however, we should discourage people from requiring specific files from the lib - these shouldn't be considered part of our public API, unless we advertise using them (like the new PluginPriorities module).

@weaverryan  It looks like Webpack Manifest Plugin 2.0.0 is out :)

Yeeeeea! @Lyrkan I just fixed conflicts, let's wait for the tests. Can you review the PR one last time to give it a üëç ? Then we can merge and finish `copyFiles()` :)
