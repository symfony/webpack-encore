I just added an unrelated, second bug fix to this, because it uses much of the same code.

It is described here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8426

Basically, when using `splitEntryChunks()`, the split filenames would change whenever a new entry required that split content - even if NOTHING else changed. The fix is simple: to set `splitChunks.name = false`, which causes the split chunk names to look like ajax split chunk names - e.g. `0.js`.
