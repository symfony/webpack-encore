Thanks for this @Kocal!

So, apparently there weren't any BC breaks that affected us? Tests are green.

TBH I've just upgraded those packages, ran tests, tests were successful, and so I pushed :sweat_smile:

Quick resume of breakings changes:
- [chai v4](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/releases/tag/4.0.0): drop node.js 0.10 and 0.12, some updates on assertions
- [chai-fs v2](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-fs/releases/tag/v1.0.0): support for Chai v3 and v4
- [sinon v3](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300--2017-08-03): remove deprecated exports
- [sinon v4](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400--2017-09-26): deps updates
- [sinon v5](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#501--2018-04-27): remove deprecated method
- [sinon v6](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600--2018-06-11): use ES modules for exports
- [sinon v7](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#700--2018-10-14): dependency update
- [sinon v8](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#800--2019-12-22): update some dependencies, remove some methods
- [sinon v9](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#900--2020-02-19): drop node.js 8 support
- [mocha v7](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#700--2020-01-05): drop node.js 6 support

It seems that we are not affected by all those updates :)
