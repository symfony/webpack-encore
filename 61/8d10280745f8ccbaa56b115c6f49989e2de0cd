Hey @florentdestremau,

Thanks for working on that, only a small thing to fix and all the tests will probably pass :)

You also forgot to replace some `@return {exports}` by `@return {Encore}` for the following methods:

* `autoProvidejQuery`
* `enablePostCssLoader`
* `enableSassLoader`
* `enableLessLoader`
* `enableStylusLoader`
* `configureBabel`
* `enableTypeScriptLoader`
* `enableCoffeeScriptLoader`
* `enableForkedTypeScriptTypesChecking`

@Lyrkan not sure what to do for the `@returns {*}` here :

@florentdestremau You can leave that one, it represents the config generated by Encore, not the API.

I can't really test if the autocompletion works right now (no PHPStorm) but based on the code it looks good to me :)

This doesn't solve the problem for me actually, when I copy / paste my new `index.js` file into my node_modules. I'm going to try by installing from my fork

Edit:

Confirmed, by using my fork I still get `Can't analyse webpack.config.js: coding assistance will ignore module resolution rules in this file`

Did you try closing/reopening PHPStorm and your `webpack.config.js` file? Maybe there is some sort of JSDoc cache?

Yes, tried reinstalling node modules after removing them and no results.
For those wanting to try out, here's the new `package.json` line to use :

    "@symfony/webpack-encore": "https://github.com/florentdestremau/webpack-encore/tarball/fix-phpstorm-unresolved-methods",

@florentdestremau I'm back on a computer with PHPStorm and it seems to work, maybe that's related to your PhpStorm configuration?

Damn, so this is a new problem on my side now :sweat_smile:
Well at least this PR seems valid.
