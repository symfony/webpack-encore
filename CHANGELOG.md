# CHANGELOG

## 5.2.0 

* Add support for Webpack CLI ^6.0.0

* Add support for babel-loader ^10.0.0

* Add support for style-loader ^4.0.0

If you manually specified the option `insert`, now it can only be a selector or the path to the module.
Follow the [style-loader migration guide](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/releases/tag/v4.0.0) to upgrade!

* Re-add `webpack-manifest-plugin` dependency, which was previously embedded in https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/pull/921

## 5.1.0

### Features

* Add support for @symfony/stimulus-bridge@^4.0.0 by @Kocal in https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/pull/1361

## 5.0.1

* #1349 Fix issue between `Encore.enableIntegrityHashes()` and filenames with a query-string (@Kocal)

## 5.0.0

This is a new major version that contains several backwards-compatibility breaks.

### Features

* #1344 Add options configuration callback to `Encore.enableReactPreset()` (@Kocal)

* #1345 Add support for integrity hashes when asset names contain a query string (@Kocal)

### BC Breaks

* #1321 Drop support of Node.js 19 and 21 (@Kocal)

* #1307 Drop `webpack-cli` 4 support, only `webpack-cli` ^5.1.4 is supported (@Kocal)

* #1318 Drop webpack-dev-server 4 support, only webpack-dev-server 5 is supported (@Kocal)

The dev-server options have changed between versions 4 and 5, see [the official migration guide to v5](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/master/migration-v5.md).
For example:
```js
// With webpack-dev-server 4:
Encore.configureDevServerOptions((options) => {
   options.https = {
     ca: "./path/to/server.pem",
     pfx: "./path/to/server.pfx",
     key: "./path/to/server.key",
     cert: "./path/to/server.crt",
     passphrase: "webpack-dev-server",
     requestCert: true,
   };
});

// With webpack-dev-server 5 (now):
Encore.configureDevServerOptions((options) => {
   options.server = {
      type: 'https',
      options: {
         ca: "./path/to/server.pem",
         pfx: "./path/to/server.pfx",
         key: "./path/to/server.key",
         cert: "./path/to/server.crt",
         passphrase: "webpack-dev-server",
         requestCert: true,
      }
   };
});
```

* #1336 Make `webpack-dev-server` dependency optional (@Kocal)

The `webpack-dev-server` package is now an optional peer dependency.
It has been removed because some projects may not use it, and it was installing a bunch of unnecessary dependencies.

Removing the `webpack-dev-server` dependency from Encore reduces the number of dependencies from **626** to **295** (**-331**!),
it helps to reduce the size of the `node_modules` directory and the number of possible vulnerabilities.

To use the `webpack-dev-server` again, you need to install it manually:
```shell
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
# or 
yarn add webpack-dev-server --dev
# or 
pnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

* #1308 Drop Vue 2 support (End-Of-Life), only Vue 3 is supported (@Kocal)

* #1309 Drop ESLint integration (@Kocal)

* #1313 Drop `clean-webpack-plugin` in favor of webpack's `output.clean` configuration. The
  configuration settings supported by `Encore.cleanupOutputBeforeBuild` have changed (@stof)

* #1324 Drop `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin` 5 support, only `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin` 7 is supported (@Kocal)

* #1342 Replace [`assets-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/ztoben/assets-webpack-plugin) dependency by an internal plugin, to generate `entrypoints.json` file (@Kocal)

* #1317 Drop support of sass-loader ^13 and ^14, add support for sass-loader ^16 (@Kocal)

The sass-loader's options have changed, [the `modern` options](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/options) are now used by default. 
Though not recommended,
you must specify the option `api: 'legacy'`
if you want to keep [the `legacy` options](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/legacystringoptions/).
For example:
```js
// With the legacy API:
Encore.enableSassLoader((options) => {
    options.api = 'legacy';
    options.includePaths = [/*...*/];
});

// With the modern API (default):
Encore.enableSassLoader((options) => {
   options.loadPaths = [/*...*/];
});
```

* #1319 Drop support of css-loader ^6, add support for css-loader ^7.1 (@Kocal)

Since [`css-loader` 7.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#700-2024-04-04),
styles imports became named by default.
It means you should update your code from:
```js
import style from "./style.css";

console.log(style.myClass);
```
to:
```js
import * as style from "./style.css";

console.log(style.myClass);
```

There is also a possibility to keep the previous behavior by configuring the `css-loader`'s `modules` option:
```js
config.configureCssLoader(options => {
   if (options.modules) {
       options.modules.namedExport = false;
       options.modules.exportLocalsConvention = 'as-is';
   } 
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you use CSS Modules inside `.vue` files,
> until https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/pull/1909 is merged and released, you will need to restore the previous 
> behavior by configuring Encore with the code above.

## 4.7.0

### Features

* #1284 Improve ESLint and Babel help messages, when enabling ESLint integration (@Kocal)

* #1285 Add support for PNPM for installation commands (@Kocal)

* #1286 Add support for Node.js 22 (@Kocal)

* #1299 Add support for less-loader 12 (@Kocal)

* #1301 Add support for postcss-loader 8 (@Kocal)

* #1302 Add support for stylus-loader 8 (@Kocal)

* #1295 Add JSX support for Vue 3 (@Kocal)

Enabling JSX support for Vue 3 is done with the `Encore.enableVueLoader()`:
```js
Encore.enableVueLoader(() => {}, { 
    useJsx: true,
    version: 3,
});
```

If you don't have a custom Babel configuration, then you're all set!
But if you do, you may need to adjust it
to add [`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-jsx) plugin to your Babel configuration:
```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        '@vue/babel-plugin-jsx'
    ]
};
```

### Features

* Add support for Svelte - #781 thanks to @zairigimad

### Bug Fixes

## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

This major release makes Encore compatible with [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

### BC Breaks

* The following dependencies **must be added** in your `package.json`: `webpack webpack-cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env` (#1142 and #1150):
```shell
npm install webpack webpack-cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev

# or via yarn
yarn add webpack webpack-cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env --dev
```

* The following dependencies **must be removed** from your `package.json` and Babel configuration: `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`,
since they are already included in `@babel/preset-env` (#1150):
```shell
npm remove @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

# or via yarn
yarn remove @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties
```

and remove it from your Encore configuration:
```diff
Encore.configureBabel((options) => {
-    config.plugins.push('@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties');
+    
})
```

## [v3.1.0](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v3.1.0)

*August 24th, 2022*

* Add vue 2.7 feature to allow dropping `vue-template-compiler` - #1134 thanks to @billyct

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

*July 8th, 2022*

This major release drops support for Node 12 (minimum is now Node 14) and
also bumps some dependencies up a new major version.

### BC Breaks

* In #1122 support for Node 12 was dropped.

* In #1133, the following dependencies were bumped a major version:

  * `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin` 3.4 -> 4.0 (4.0 just drops Node 12 support)
  * `less-loader` 10 -> 11
  * `postcss-loader` 6 -> 7
  * `sass-loader` 12 -> 13
  * `stylus` 0.57 -> 0.58
  * `stylus-loader` 6 -> 7

If you're using any of these (all are optional except for `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`
and are extended them with custom configuration, check the CHANGELOG of each for
any possible BC breaks).

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

*May 3rd, 2022*

This is a new major version that contains several backwards-compatibility breaks.

### BC Breaks

The following dependencies were upgraded a major version. It's unlikely
these will cause problems, unless you were further configuring this part
of Encore:

* `clean-webpack-plugin` Version `3` to `4`: dropped old Node & Webpack version support
* `css-loader` Version `5` to `6`: dropped old Node version support & [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-breaking-changes)
* `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin` Version `2` to `3`: dropped old Node version support
* `loader-utils` REMOVED
* `mini-css-extract-plugin` Version `1.5` to `2.2.1`: dropped old Node & Webpack version support & [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-breaking-changes)
* `pretty-error` Version `3.0` to `4.0`: dropped old Node version support
* `resolve-url-loader` Version `3.0` to `5.0`: dropped old Node version support, requires postcss `^8.0`, remove `rework` engine & [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/blob/v4-maintenance/packages/resolve-url-loader/CHANGELOG.md)
* `style-loader` Version `2` to `3`: dropped old Node and Webpack version support & [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-breaking-changes)
* `yargs-parser` Version `20.2` to `21`: dropped old Node version support

Additionally, Encore changed the supported versions of the following packages,
which you may have installed to enable extra features:

* `eslint` Minimum version increased from `7` to `8`
* `eslint-webpack-plugin` Minimum version increased from `2.5` to `3`
* `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` Minimum version increased from `5` to `6` [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
* `less-loader` Minimum version increased from `7` to `10`
* `postcss-loader` Minimum version increased from `4` to `6`
* `preact` Minimum version increased from `8` to `10` [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/releases/tag/10.0.0)
* `sass-loader` Minimum version increased from `9` to `12`
* `stylus` Minimum version increased from `0.54` to `0.56`
* `stylus-loader` Minimum version increased from `3` to `6` [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/stylus-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400-2020-09-29)
* `vue-loader` Minimum version increased from `16` to `17` [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md#1700-2021-12-12)

* Removed `Encore.enableEslintLoader()`: use `Encore.enableEslintPlugin()`.

* If using `enableEslintPlugin()` with the `@babel/eslint-parser` parser,
  you may now need to create an external Babel configuration file. To see
  an example, temporarily delete your `.eslintrc.js` file and run Encore.
  The error will show you a Babel configuration file you can use.

* With `configureDefinePlugin()`, the `options['process.env']` key format
  passed to the callback has changed (see #960). If you are using `configureDefinePlugin()`
  to add more items to `process.env`, your code will need to change:

```diff
Encore.configureDefinePlugin((options) => {
-    options['process.env']['SOME_VAR'] = JSON.stringify('the value');
+    options['process.env.SOME_VAR'] = JSON.stringify('the value');
})

*February 24th, 2020*

### Bug Fix

- [#697](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/pull/697) - Fix source maps being generated by default in dev - *@Lyrkan*


## 0.28.0

 * Don't make `@babel/preset-env` use `forceAllTransforms` option
   in production - this will reduce build size in production
   for environments that only need to support more modern
   browsers - #612 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added support with `enablePostCssLoader()` to process files
   ending in `.postcss` or using `lang="postcss"` in Vue - #594
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Allow `resolve-url-loader` to be configured via `enableSassLoader()` -
   #603 thanks to @diegocardoso93.

 * Support was removed from Node 9 (a no-longer-supported version
   of Node) - #585 thanks to @weaverryan

 * [BC Break] Removed the ability to use `[chunkhash]` in
   `configureFilenames()`, which was already deprecated and
   no longer reliable - #608 thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.27.0

 * [Behavior Change] The Babel configuration `sourceType` default was
   changed from not being specified (so, the default `module` was used)
   to `unambiguous`. This is to help Babel's `useBuiltIns` functionality
   properly determine if a `require` or `import` should be automatically
   added to your files, based on that file's style - #555 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added JSX support to Vue! #553 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Cleaned up the jsdoc in `index.js` to add better docs and better
   IDE auto-completion - #550 thank sto @Lyrkan.

## 0.26.0

 * [Behavior change] The Babel `useBuiltIns` option default value changed
   from `entry` to `false`, which means that polyfills may no longer be
   provided in the same way. This is due to a change in Babel and core-js.
   To get the same functionality back, run `yarn add core-js --dev`, then use:

   ```js
   Encore.configureBabel(() => {}, {
       useBuiltIns: 'entry', // or try "usage"
       corejs: 3
   })
   ```

   This comes from #545 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added the ability to "resolve" CSS and Sass files without specifying
   the file extension and by taking advantage of the `sass` or `style`
   attribute in an npm package. For example, you can now import the main
   Bootstrap SASS file from within a SASS file by saying `@import ~bootstrap`.
   This will use the `sass` attribute from the bootstrap `package.json`
   file to find which file to load. #474 thanks to @deAtog.

 * Added a new `Encore.enableIntegrityHashes()`, which will cause a new
   `integrity` key to be added to `entrypoints.json` with integrity values
   that can be included in the `script` or `link` tag for that asset - #522
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Allow some parts of `configureBabel()` to be used, even if there is
   an external `.babelrc` configuration file - #544 thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.25.0

 * [BC BREAK] Various dependency versions were updated, including
   `css-loader` updated from `^1.0.0` to `^2.1.1` and `resolve-url-loader`
   updated from `^2.3.0` to `^3.0.1`. The minimum Node version was
   also bumped from 6 to 8. See #540 for more details.

 * Added `Encore.disableCssExtraction()` if you prefer your CSS to
   be output via the `style-loader` - #539 thank to @Lyrkan.

 * Added `Encore.configureLoaderRule()` as a way to configure the
   loader config that Encore normally handles - #509 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Babel cache is no longer used for production builds to avoid a
   bug where the cache prevents browserslist from being used - #516
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.24.0

 * Add CSS modules support in Vue.js for Sass/Less/Stylus - #511
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow to use Dart Sass instead of Node Sass - #517 thanks to
   @Lyrkan

 * Allow to set a custom context in copyFiles - #518 thanks to
   @Lyrkan

 * Improve 'Install x to use y' and 'Unrecognized method' error
   messages - #520 thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow to set @babel/preset-env's useBuiltIns option - #521
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow setOutputPath to create nested directories - #525 thanks
   to @Lyrkan

## 0.23.0

 * Add support for CSS modules in Vue - #508 thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Store externals in an array - #495 thanks to @deAtog

 * Add `Encore.isRuntimeEnvironmentConfigured()` - #500 thanks
   to @stof.

 * Add the ability to configure watch options - #486 thanks
   to @Kocal

 * Enabled cache and parallelism for terser for faster builds -
   #497 thanks to @Kocal

## 0.22.0

 * [BC BREAK] The values/paths in entrypoints.json were previously
   stripped of their opening slash. That behavior has been changed:
   the opening slash is now included: Before: `build/foo.js`, After: `/build/foo.js`.

## 0.21.0

 * [BC BREAK] Webpack was upgraded to version 4. This includes a number of major
   and minor changes. The changes are listed below under the
   `Webpack 4 Upgrade` section.

 * [BC BREAK] The `createSharedEntry()` no longer can be passed an array of files.
   Instead, set this to just one file, and require the other files from inside that
   file.

 * [DEPRECATION] You must now call either `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`
   or `Encore.disableSingleRuntimeChunk()`: not calling either method is
   deprecated. The recommended setting is `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`.
   This will cause a new `runtime.js` file to be created, which must be included
   on your page with a script tag (before any other script tags for Encore
   JavaScript files). See the documentation above `enableSingleRuntimeChunk()` in
   `index.js` for more details.

 * [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Previously, without any config, Babel was
   configured to "transpile" (i.e. re-write) your JavaScript so
   that it was compatible with all browsers that currently have
   more than 1% of the market share. The new default behavior
   is a bit more aggressive, and may rewrite even more code to
   be compatible with even older browsers. The *recommendation*
   is to add a new `browserslist` key to your `package.json` file
   that specifies exactly what browsers you need to support. For
   example, to get the old configuration, add the following to
   `package.json`:

```json
{
    "browserslist": "> 1%"
}
```

See the [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) library
for a full description of all of the valid browser descriptions.

 * Added a new `copyFiles()` method that is able to copy static files
   into your build directory and allows them to be versioned. #409
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Introduced a new `configureSplitChunks()` method that can be
   used to further configure the `optimizations.splitChunks` configuration.

 * A new `entrypoints.json` file is now always output. For expert
   use-cases, the `optimizations.splitChunks.chunks` configuration
   can be set via `configureSplitChunks()` to `all`. Then, you
   can write some custom server-side code to parse the `entrypoints.js`
   so that you know which `script` and `link` tags are needed for
   each entry.

 * The "dynamic import" syntax is now supported out of the box
   because the `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` babel plugin
   is always enabled. This allows you to do "Dynamic Imports"
   as described here: https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports

 * A new "version check" system was added for optional dependencies.
   Now, when you install optional plugins to support a feature, if
   you are using an unsupported version, you will see a warning.
   "Package recommendation" errors (i.e. when you enable a feature
   but you are missing some packages) will also contain the version
   in the install string when necessary (e.g. `yarn add foo@^2.0`).

 * Support was added `handlebars-loader` by calling `enableHandlebarsLoader()`.
   #301 thanks to @ogiammetta

 * Support was added for `eslint-loader` by calling `enableEslintLoader()`.
   #243 thanks to @pinoniq

 * The `css-loader` can now be configured by calling `configureCssLoader()`.
   #335 thanks to @XWB

 * It's now possible to control the `exclude` for Babel so that you can
   process certain node_modules packages  through Babel - use
   the new second argument to `configureBabel()` - #401 thanks to
   @Lyrkan.

## Webpack 4 Upgrade Details

 * Node 7 is no longer supported. This is because the new
   `mini-css-extract-plugin` does not support it (and neither)
   does Yarn.

 * For Preact, the necessary plugin the user needs to install
   changed from `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` to `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`.

 * The NamedModulesPlugin was removed.

 * The `babel-preset-env` package (which was at version ^1.2.2) was
   removed in favor of `@babel/preset-env`.

 * ExtractTextPlugin was removed and replaced with
   mini-css-extract-plugin. Accordingly, `extractTextPluginOptionsCallback()`
   was removed.

 * Support for CoffeeScript was entirely removed.

 * Actual lang="sass" no longer works for Vue. However, lang="scss"
   continues to work fine.

 * uglifyjs-webpack-plugin was replaced by terser-webpack-plugin.
   If you're using `configureUglifyJsPlugin()`, please switch to
   `configureTerserPlugin()` instead.
