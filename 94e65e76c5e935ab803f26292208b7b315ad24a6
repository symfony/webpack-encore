@Lyrkan Is there anything else that needs to be taken care of in this PR?

Is there an way to have appveyor run again? I dont understand why it failed. If it is a concern. If not we can just leave it with the 1 check failed.

Don't worry about AppVeyor, it happens to fail for no real reason sometimes (mostly because of timeouts during functional tests), which seems to be the case here.
