Thanks @Kocal, I think that we **really** need this :)

Not a big issue imo, the message looks fine (**edit:** ahah, no wonder it looks fine and really similar to the ones we already have after pushing that missing commit ðŸ˜„).

Yeah, the ones on AppVeyor have been there for a while now (and I still have no clue what causes them...), and the ones on Travis are related to TypeScript (a bit weird that they only happen for that job though).
