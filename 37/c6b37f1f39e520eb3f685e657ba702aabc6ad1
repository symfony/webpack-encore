You're correct - there's no problem with allowing less-loader 9, as we still allow versions that support Node 10.

However, it's definitely made a mess for the tests. I've just pushed what will hopefully be a workaround.

Well, Node 10 is no longer supported since the beginning of this month, so we could consider dropping support for it altogether if that makes it easier ðŸ˜€

Iâ€™m concerned about ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which I believe comes with node 10. And to bump to 12 just for this reason would be unfortunate :)

Plus, I think my last commit fixed things. Appveyor is broken still, but Iâ€™m not sure we need to anymore, as we have windows tested by GH actions.

@weaverryan Is there anything left to do for me before this can be merged and released?
