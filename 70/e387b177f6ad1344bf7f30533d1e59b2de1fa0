Hi @gustawdaniel,

Would you be able to rebase and run `yarn` again to fix the `yarn.lock` conflict?

I can't because I removed my fork. Probably simplest solution is allow to made this change manually by somebody who can merge.

https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github

This is only replace

```
    "url-loader": "^1.0.1",
```

by

```
    "url-loader": "^1.0.1 || ^2.0.1",
```

in `package.json`
