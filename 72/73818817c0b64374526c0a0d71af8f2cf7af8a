This is ready to go üç∞  Notes:

* HMR works for JavaScript (wooohoo!) but not for styles, because we're using ExtractTextPlugin like the rest of the library (see #3)

* I added the `.vue` extension always, not just when the vue-loader is enabled. This should give better errors - if I use vue and require a `.vue` file without the extension, instead of not finding the file, you'll get an error about the `vue-loader` needing to be enabled.

I added one more commit to change the vue-loader options to a callback - consistent with #50 and `configureBabelLoader()`
