By the way, should I start working (now) on a PR for [symfony/symfony-docs](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs)?

Hey @Kocal!

I'm for this change - it's one of the ugliest things to try to hack into the Encore config. I merged a PR ahead of this - could you fix the conflict?

About the docs, I think the feature is already mostly documented in the code (you've done a nice job). But, I think it would probably be worth mentioning here https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/advanced-config.html

Thanks!

Hey,

I totally fucked up my rebase+force push, I didn't checked that my local branch was outdated and commits were reduced from ~10 to 3 :sweat_smile: Thanks to Travis and GitHub, I was able to retrieve what I've done (even if that's not really funny to manually apply 7 patches).

Some of my tests broke due to last changes on Encore (in particular Sass, SCSS, Stylus... loaders). I will fix them and ping you when I finished.

Also, I will work ASAP on a PR for symfony-docs :)
