Note that due to the new required peer dependency, this requires releasing it as a new major version.

I was thinking the same, which is ok. To be clear, the new peer dependency is `webpack` itself.

So I'm still wondering about `webpack-cli`. This is NOT currently listed as a `peerDependency`. However, in all of the "test apps", it IS installed. Why isn't this a required peer dependency?

It is an optional peer dependency of `webpack`, that must be installed to be able to use webpack in the CLI (rather than using it programmatically). And so, in Encore, we need it.

I suggest adding `webpack-cli` as a mandatory peer dependency of Encore, instead of having the first usage of Encore failing and asking the user to install webpack-cli.

Re-added `webpack-cli` as a required peer dependency.
